#Security 
This application deals with highly sensitive user information. There is inherent security in design becasue all variables that are not
needed to be public are public and variables that should not be access or modified by the user are transient. (There are currently no transients needed) 

This program lacks a GUI and thus a user must be technically adpet, the limits the scope of the program so that general users will not be 
able to exploit this program. We will eventaully be adding a frontend that will have a password. 

This program also understands the common security practice of changing the port that SSH is used on. Therefore we allowed the user to specifiy 
the port that is available to be used. 

The maximum amount of security practical for this program has been used at this point.
