You will need to know how to use bash to run a java program.

Compile: 
javac -cp [FilePath]/.:Jsch.jar [FilePath]/sshbrute.java 

Run: java -cp [FilePath]/.Jsch.jar [FilePath]/sshbrute.java 
This will give you the Syntax for using the commmand 

Build your testing Dictionary: touch wordlist and use cat to create the list 

Now you can do the run again but this time make sure that you use 3 arguements in the proper Syntax.
